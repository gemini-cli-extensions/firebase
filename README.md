The Gemini CLI can access all the tools of the Firebase MCP server as well as commands that access pre-written prompts that help streamline common app development journeys:

### `/firebase:init`
This command provides you options like setting up backend services for your app and implementing genAI features that access the Gemini API.

- **Backend services:** Sets up and writes the code for Cloud Firestore database as well as Firebase Authentication to secure your app and user data. It can even deploy your app to an appropriate Firebase hosting service.
- **Gen AI features:** Sets up Firebase AI Logic and writes the code to easily and securely access the Gemini API directly from your mobile and web apps.

### `/firebase:deploy`
This command deploys your application to a Firebase hosting service by analyzing your code and determining if you need static app hosting or a full-stack hosting solution.

### `/firebase:consult`
